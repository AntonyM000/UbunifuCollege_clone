                <p>
                Over the past 100 years, alot of areas in life have been revolutionized but education is not one of them. Historically, higher education has avoided competitive disruption. One reason for this past immunity is the power of prestige in the higher education marketplace, where the quality of the product is hard to measure. At Ubunifu Our focus is to graduate all students innovation ready, ready to solve problems creatively.
